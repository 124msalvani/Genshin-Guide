        <h1 class="display-4"><b>Overview</b></h1>
        <h5>Eula is popular because of extremely powerful DPS capabilities. She can dish out huge amounts of damage in big bursts, and is a very rewarding character to play.</h5>
      </div>

      <h1><u>Elemental Skill: Icetide Vortex </u></h1>
      <h5>Eula’s Elemental Skill is a simple slash that deals Cryo damage. Your Tap E gives you Grimheart stacks, that you can expend on your Hold E to gain more damage, and at 2 Grimheart stacks, you gain access to a Physical and Cryo resistance reduction on enemies, which helps you, again, deal more damage.
        </h5>
        <h3><b>Eula’s Elemental Skill is the basis of why she is such a top-tier Physical damage carry and competitive hyper-carry in general. One of the weaknesses of a Physical carry is they inherently lack modified or extra damage through reactions, and they have to compensate with higher base values on attacks. Having an in-built Physical and Cryo resistance shred means Eula is reliable and self-sufficient, even in situations where she cannot gain access to Superconduct. </b></h3>

      <div class="col">
        <h1><u><br>Elemental Burst: Glacial Illumination </u></h1>
        <h5>Glacial Illumination is a charged-up time bomb. After you cast it, you have seven seconds to gather Lightfall Sword stacks through using your Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst. After the 7s duration is over, the Burst will detonate, dealing AoE Physical damage based on how many stacks you have gained. </h5>
        <h3><b>Its massive multipliers and damage number once you learned how to get the maximum stacks every Burst cast is one of the most addictive factors in playing Eula. There are only very few Bursts in the game that can reach Eula’s level of damage, and most of them need outside assistance/require reactions. Glacial Illumination does not snapshot. This means her detonation damage will be calculated in real time, using stats at the time it detonates. This means Eula has very low synergy with units that have buff times below 10s, such as Sara, as her highest damage source cannot be buffed by their kit. Units such as Bennett, Xinyan C4, which run on a 12s buff timer, are workable with Eula, but the timing may be quite tight depending on your rotations. Eula’s biggest strength is also her biggest weakness. She puts all her eggs into the Burst basket, and if she misses, it devastates her damage, not the enemy health bar. Because of this, be mindful of when and where you are casting your Burst.

        <h1><u>Constellations </u></h1>
        <h3>C1: Tidal Illusion</h3>
        <h5>
         A very straightforward Constellation that gives you very good damage gain as you flow naturally through your rotation. Just remember, having this constellation means you are now triply incentivized to hit that 2 stack Grimheart Hold E for the most consistent and highest damage gain possible. Don’t forget the stacks!</h5>

        <h3>C2: Lady of Seafoam</h3>
        <h5>
          A quite niche, situationally good constellation. Great for Main DPS Eula, but isn't used during Burst DPS rotations due to the long casting time.
        </h5>
        <h3>C3: Lawrence Pedigree</h3>
        <h5>
          +3 to her Burst. Incredible constellation, makes her Burst even more unstoppable. Completely cracked, a straight damage increase.
        </h5>
        <h3>C4: The Obstinacy of One's Inferiors</h3>
        <h5>
          This constellation is not great, as the DMG% is additive with other bonuses such as Physical DMG% from your artifact/weapon.
        </h5>
        <h3>C5: Chivalric Quality</h3>
        <h5>
          +3 to her Skill. Minor increase, but still good.
        </h5>

        <h3> C6: Noble Obligation</h3>
        <h5>If you are a whale, this is the constellation for you. Undeniably Eula’s strongest constellation, it is understandable why it is a C6. Eula’s Elemental Burst caps out its damage at 30 stacks, but C6 is the only way you can hit that threshold, for the highest single-instanced, achievable damage in the game. Expect going from 14 stacks to 24-26 stacks per Burst on average.
